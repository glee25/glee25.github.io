## Coding Templates
When we are tasked with a difficult problem or question, we often think of many ways of going about solving these problems. 

When it comes to hard questions or problems that we face in life we often have many ways of thinking about it. We can go with the obvious answer where it may be easy but we will 
get it done or we could take the un-practical way and stand out. But there are problems where there is one solution that we would use. Like typing an essay like this one we would 
go to google docs or word and start typing away. Just like design patterns we use this as a template. We have the options to use rough outlines that are present to problems that 
a lot of people have. Examples of this are in docs we can pick from templates like MLA to style your paper in the MLA format, or a report that has to have a cover page and many 
more. For software developers this is known as design patterns which are pretty much these templates for solving similar problems that will help you structure your solution. 
Let say you are making a web application that will have multiple profiles on one page you would be able to find a design pattern to help you with this. Even though we know that 
there would be different things going on in the web application we can still use the profiles form the design pattern to help us with the profiles.
