### Introduction to Javascript

Learning Javascript so far has not been as much as a struggle as I thought it would be. It is very similar to coding languages that I have already learned in my previous classes such as Java, HTML, and C++. These languages are similar in a sense that they make coding in them a little more convinent with shortcuts that other languages do not have. In resepects to the ES6 excercises, I have learned these coding strategies before but it has been a while since I practiced them so this exercise was a really good refresher. In my opinion, I think that Javascript is one of the better coding languages as it's not too difficult to get a grasp of if you already know another coding language. 

### Honing my Coding Skills

I thought that our practice WOD's (Workout of the Day) were very beneficial for me personally. They benefitted me by giving me a sense of how much more I need to work on my coding skills as I am not finishing these WOD's as fast as I would like to. I think this style of learning is very enjoyable as it keeps us on our toes and can see how much our work we put into this is paying off. This style of learning would work for me as I am a very independent learner and this gives me a chance to test my understanding of the subject.
