##Experience with RadGrad

After completing the RadGrad New User tutorial I have a new perspective on computer science. From the tutorial, I learned that there are many different opportunities at UH for computer science that I didn't know were available to us before. I also learned more about what classes I plan to take for next semester and also the “ICE” score gave me a good gauge as to how I am doing so for my college career.

From completing this RadGrad tutorial I have learned about many different interests and opportunities that I would like to take advantage of before I graduate. One opportunity that I discovered from finishing this tutorial was the hackathons that take place during the semester. After reading about them from RadGrad, I would like to take part in one of them before I graduate because it seems very interesting and it might be something that will help me in the future while pursuing my career.

In conclusion, I think that RadGrad is a great tool for college students like me who are not very aware about the opportunities that are available to them. I wish that I had learned about this sooner as I would have taken part in more of these opportunities to help me gain more coding experience and also broaden my connections. In my opinion, I think that RadGrad would most likely help me have a better degree experience because of all the opportunities that it provides information about.
