## My Experience...
In ICS 414, I gained many tools and experiences I will need in my future career. Some of these tool teamwork, consumer experience, web developing skill, and many more. Throughout my experience in ICS 414 this semester I learned alot about time management. I feel like this class alongside other classes really makes you allocate your time correctly. This is through our classes being short and most of the work you have to do is individually. Since there were very few instructions we were going based on our own which helped me with looking up the resources that I would need to do my task. There are tasks that were too hard to do which I would ask my group mates to help me with. I have learned that some weeks it was very difficult to find time to work on this project on top of all my other classes. Overall the biggest take away from this class is working with people. I do think that this class and the takeaways will help me out with my future by working with others and on a project for a long period of time.
