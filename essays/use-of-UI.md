## Behind the Scenes of UI

Looking at a website you are first presented with a user interface this is what everyone sees when they look at your website. It looks good on the eyes and is very appealing. Looks and seams easy to do right? Welp I’m here to say that it's not as simple as it may seem. Using HTML and CSS to make a website by itself is not the best way in looking at things. We are very limited to what we can produce using just the raw forms of these languages. We can create websites using them but there are better ways in which we can achieve this. Knowing this we used something called Semantic UI. 

My thoughts on Semantic UI is that it was really easy on how we can implement the classes we would need to use. But simple doesn’t always mean easier. Due to the classes using very simple words like “item”,”container”, ect. We know just by the context what this class is supposed to do. I really like this part of Semantic UI. But when those classes didn’t do what it was supposed to do is where the tricky part comes in. Be sure you know that you are about to spend a lot of time on inspecting elements and trying different things to your code. I found myself doing this a lot especially when I had to recreate a website. One more annoying thing that I have found with this was with the div tags. I found that I either had one to many or was missing one and when looking at how it turned out it was all weird.

It really got me thinking about how much time and effort it takes to make a good user interface. Not only the coding part of it but the planning on how the page is going to look and how it will appeal to the consumer. I also think this is a good skill for software engineers so if they have to tweak the website they can or even if they just want to understand what the website is trying to do I feel like the skill you gain from learning this is really important.
