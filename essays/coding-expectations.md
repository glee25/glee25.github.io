## The Coding Standards ...

What is a "Coding Standard" and why is it important to follow? These are the questions I had to ask myself when first hearing about coding standards. But similar to essays or a recipe, there is a correct way to write code. There are multiple ways to write it but it depends on what you want to accomplish. Following coding standards helps with keep the code organized and help with making it easier to understand. This is mostly due to the spacing needed to follow the standards which makes the code easier to read. Actually following this standards of coding is much more difficult than it sounds.

I would say coding standards are difficult for me now but after completing this class, hopefully it will be a whole other story. Using IntelliJ is really helping me with following these standards as it gives me a constant reminder if I am typing something wrong. This forces me to be more mindful of my spacing and how my code looks. This also helps with finding errors right away and not after I write all the code where it will be more difficult to fix. This tool will be very useful in my future as I plan on coding as a career and in classes to come.

In conclusion, these coding standards are there to help users with making their code look neat and readable. This will help when you need to work with others on the same code as they will have an easier time understanding the code they write. These are my expectations for coding standards and what I feel about it this far into the class. I know that in the future, I will be glad that I was able to practice these coding standards early.
