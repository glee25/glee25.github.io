For this project, we had to research a spcific CPU of our choosing and present our learnings to the class. Some things we studied about the CPU were things such as the architecture of the CPU, branch predictions, and its memory. More information about this project can be found below using the link provided.


Our CPU Presentation slide can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wcc7K9j3mxnmtCiuFnWUoXxHL3YyXyywKgIy8eUC-80/edit?usp=sharing) for reference.
