summary: An internship project where we had to develop a website for the state.
---

In this intership project, we were tasked with developing a website for the state of Hawaii for the new storm water utilities fee that they are planning on implementing soon. This website needed to show users facts on the subject at hand and also show them what the cost of the fee would be for their property. The website we created can be found [here](https://dev.cimp2021.datahouse.com/Home).
